	Initial version.

20071029:
	Moved build_tools target into top-level Makefile
	Put 'tboot=0x1234' (where 1234 is the addr of the tboot_shared data)
	    on VMM/kernel command line, per latest Xen feedback
	Changed TB_LAUNCH_ERR_IDX to 0x20000002
	Made TPM detailed debug ouput conditional
	Changes TBOOT_S3_WAKEUP_ADDR to 0x8a000 to ensure no conflicts

20071128:
	Added '-f' command line option to lcptools/tpmnv_getcap to display the
	    TPM_PERMANENT_FLAGS and TPM_STCLEAR_FLAGS contents
	Revised the docs/policy.txt steps
	Code and build re-factoring and cleanup (default target is now 'build')
	Make memory logging build-time optional and disable by default
	Support >2 cores/threads
	Move tboot to load and execute at 16MB (this also now protects it from
	    dom0 access since it's memory type can be E820_UNUSABLE now)
	    *** this requires a patch to Xen ***
	The Xen command line shoudl have 'no-real-mode' removed and 'vtd=1'
	    added (as indicated in the updated docs/tboot-info.txt)
	    setting 'vtd=1' is optional but some systems fail to boot dom0
	    otherwise
	    *** setting 'vtd=1' will cause S3 resume to fail ***
	Updated trousers sub-directory to download 0.3.1 version from TrouSerS
	    SourceForge site and build it
